## What is Beat?

Beat is a decentralized social exchange protocol where **every verified human generates 10 BEAT per day** simply by existing.

Not cryptocurrency. Not fiat. **Different money** for a parallel economy.

### Core Principles

- **🫀 Universal Basic Income** — 10 BEAT/day for everyone, forever
- **🛡️ Fireproof Base** — First 5,000 BEAT protected from demurrage
- **💧 Progressive Demurrage** — Money above 5,000 melts (forces circulation)
- **🔒 Privacy First** — Zero-knowledge proofs, no surveillance
- **🌍 Global Protocol, Local Value** — Works everywhere, priced locally
- **🤝 Symbolic Exchange** — Recognition of value, not exploitation

## Why Beat?

### The Problem (2026)
```
Financial Surveillance: Every card purchase tracked
AI Displacement: What remains uniquely human?
Inequality: Money creation = power concentration
```

### The Solution
```
Beat gives you:
  ✓ Daily income (10 BEAT) just for existing
  ✓ Safety net (5,000 BEAT fireproof base)
  ✓ Financial privacy (ZK proofs)
  ✓ Protection from hoarding (demurrage)
  ✓ Local autonomy (no global price fixing)
```

## How It Works

### 1. Daily Heartbeat
Every verified human generates **10 BEAT/day** (fixed, no growth).

### 2. Fireproof Safety Net
Your first **5,000 BEAT** are protected forever (0% demurrage).

### 3. Progressive Melting
Money above 5,000 melts progressively:
- 5,000-10,000 BEAT: -5%/month
- 10,000-20,000 BEAT: -10%/month  
- 20,000+ BEAT: -15%/month

**Result:** Can't hoard wealth. Must circulate.

### 4. Privacy
- Biometrics stay on device (never uploaded)
- Zero-knowledge proofs for identity
- P2P transfers (no central tracking)

### 5. Local Pricing
- 10 BEAT in Bangkok ≠ 10 BEAT in London (purchasing power)
- Communities set their own prices
- No global exchange rate

## Important Disclaimer

### AI-Assisted Development

This whitepaper and initial concept were **formulated through conversation with Claude (Anthropic AI)** on February 14, 2026.

**What this means:**
- The ideas emerged from human-AI dialogue
- Technical details synthesized by AI from existing knowledge
- Economic model built on established theory (Gesell, Laborde)
- **No code written yet** — this is conceptual phase

**Why transparent:**
- Honesty about process is critical for trust-based system
- AI as tool for exploration, not replacement for human judgment
- Community will validate, critique, and improve
- Final decisions = human community, not AI

**The human contributor** brought:
- Core philosophical insights (fireproof base, symbolic exchange)
- Real-world use cases (photographer with zines, political sensitivity)
- Economic intuitions (demurrage must apply to all, not just pocket)

**The AI (Claude)** contributed:
- Technical architecture knowledge
- Cryptographic schemes (ZK proofs, etc.)
- Synthesis of economic theory (TRM, Gesell)
- Documentation structure

This collaboration model is itself an experiment in human-AI co-creation.
